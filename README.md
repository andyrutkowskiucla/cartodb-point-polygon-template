This is a templatefor a cartoDB client that includes support for interactive point and polygon layers. It also includes hover windows that use Underscore.js templating to display data from your cartoDB table.

<h2>Usage</h2>

Most eveything is editable in index.html (legend, hover window textfields, buttons), app.js (account, table and layer information, and geocoding), and appUI.js (hover window behavior, textfield stuff).


Let me know if you use it / have any changes. @mhkeller
